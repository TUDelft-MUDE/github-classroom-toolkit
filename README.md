# github-classroom-toolkit

workflow:
first create grades on brightspace in a certain format. see brightspace section
and get classlist file from brightspace and edit it in a certain way (most importantly: get the github usernames)

then either use CLI or run scripts to get raw json, summaries and grade files.
for buddycheck: download csv from brightspace

finally upload grade json to brightspace. if brightspace grades are created in the correct way, this will import all grades correctly.
if cli:

if scripts:
1. download accepted students (or student grades) json from github classroom or buddycheck csv from brightspace
2. run scripts for GA (..), PA (..) or BC (..)
3. upload 

warning: as of xxx/xx/2025 it seems grade file sometimes does not correspond to passing... ?
